<h1>Blackjack</h1>

A simple game of **Blackjack** (also known as twenty-one) where the user plays against a CPU dealer.

The player will start off with 50 coins and can bet up to the amount they have every round.

Once the cards are dealt, the player will have the option to _hit_, _stand_, or _double_.
<ul>
  <li>If the player <em>hits</em>, they will draw a card. If the player's combined card values exceed 21, they bust and lose the round. </li>
  <li>If the player <em>stands</em>, they will end their turn and the dealer will start their turn. </li>
  <li>If the player <em>doubles</em>, they will double their bet, draw one card, and then end their turn. They must have enough coins before doubling. </li>
</ul>

The dealer will continue to _hit_ until their card values reach 17 or higher. If the dealer goes over 21, they bust and the player wins. Otherwise, whoever is closer to 21 wins.
